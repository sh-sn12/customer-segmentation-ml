##  Overview

This project focuses on customer segmentation using unsupervised learning techniques to understand and categorize online shopping behaviors.  
By applying the LRFS (Length, Recency, Frequency, Staying rate) model, Autoencoder-based dimensionality reduction, and K-Means clustering, we identify key customer groups based on behavioral patterns.  

This segmentation helps e-commerce platforms:
- Personalize marketing strategies  
- Improve customer retention  
- Increase conversion rates

##  Project Workflow

| Phase | Description |
|:------|:-------------|
| Phase 0 | Environment setup and library installation |
| Phase 1 | Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Trend visualization, purchase behavior study |
| Phase 2| LRFS Feature Engineering: Extracted Length, Recency, Frequency, Staying rate |
| Phase 3 | Dimensionality Reduction using Autoencoder and t-SNE |
| Phase 4 | Clustering & Profiling using K-Means and K-Medoids |
| Phase 5 | Explainability, Visualization (Plotly), and Streamlit Dashboard creation |

## üß† Methodology

### üßæ Step 1: Data Understanding
- Dataset: Online Shoppers Intention Dataset (UCI / Kaggle)
- Shape: ~12,000 rows √ó 18 features  
- Key columns: *Administrative, Informational, ProductRelated, Month, SpecialDay, Revenue*

### ‚öôÔ∏è Step 2: LRFS Feature Engineering
Derived new behavioral features:
| Feature | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **L (Length)** | Total number of session visits |
| **R (Recency)** | Time since last visit |
| **F (Frequency)** | Number of visits over a period |
| **S (Staying Rate)** | Average duration of interaction |

### üß© Step 3: Autoencoder Dimensionality Reduction
- Reduced LRFS feature space to **2 latent dimensions** (`Dim1`, `Dim2`)
- Captures hidden relationships in user behavior data.

### üîÆ Step 4: K-Means Clustering
- Applied K-Means (k=4) for segmentation
- Evaluated cluster quality using **Silhouette Score**
- Visualized cluster distribution in latent space.

### üß≠ Step 5: Explainability & Visualization
-  model interpretation.  
- Created interactive charts using **Plotly** and **Seaborn**.

##  Results

| Cluster | Segment Name | Conversion Rate | Key Behavior |
|:--------:|:-------------|:----------------|:--------------|
| 0 | üü° Occasional Shoppers | 25% | Moderate frequency and recent visits |
| 1 | üîµ New Explorers | 24% | New users exploring the site |
| 2 | üî¥ Window Shoppers | 8% | Low engagement, quick exits |
| 3 | üü¢ Loyal Frequent Buyers | 41% | High frequency, strong loyalty |

### üß© Business Insights
- **Cluster 3** customers are most valuable; should be rewarded with loyalty benefits.  
- **Cluster 2** users show low engagement; target with reactivation campaigns.  
- **Clusters 0 & 1** can be converted with personalized offers.
